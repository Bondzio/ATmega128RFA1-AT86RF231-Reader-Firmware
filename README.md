Our startup company provides an advanced system for Operators in the Commercial Laundry Industry to replace coins and smart cards using an online solution to manage their business, primarily by automating the collection of revenue, reducing service cost and having a user create a prepaid laundry account. 
A micro-controller, ATmega128RF including a radio chip AT86RF231 transmits the data that came from the RF card to identify the user. This data is used to access the user account to determine if there is sufficient funds to satisfy the vend.
